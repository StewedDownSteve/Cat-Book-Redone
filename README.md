# CatBook Redone! 
A simple web app to manage a database of cats, where users can upload cat profiles with pictures, edit cat information, and view a list of cats. The app demonstrates core full-stack development skills, including CRUD functionality, reusable components, and interactive JavaScript features.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS (Embedded JavaScript), Bootstrap

This project was built as a full-stack CRUD app with the following features:

- **Create**: Users can upload a new cat profile with a name, age, favorite food, fun fact, and an image.
- **Read**: Users can browse a list of cat profiles, viewing each cat's details.
- **Update**: Users can edit any cat's profile directly from the app.
- **Delete**: Users can remove a cat's profile from the app.

Some of the core technologies and concepts used in this project:

- **Node.js & Express**: Backend server and routing.
- **MongoDB**: Database management for storing cat profiles.
- **EJS templates**: To dynamically render the HTML with reusable components, such as a navbar and footer, for a consistent UI.
- **JavaScript & Bootstrap**: To handle form interactions, validate inputs, and create responsive styling.
  
Additionally, I customized the app with a few unique features:

- **Image preview on upload**: Users can see a preview of the uploaded cat photo before submitting the form, enhancing the UX.
- **Custom styling**: I personalized the Bootstrap-based design, making sure the app has a polished and user-friendly interface, including a sticky footer that always stays at the bottom of the screen.

## Optimizations

As I built the project, I made several improvements:

- Implemented **client-side image preview** to enhance user experience.
- Refined form validation and error handling, ensuring users can't submit incomplete or incorrect data.
- Improved UI responsiveness by tweaking CSS and Bootstrap components, ensuring the app works smoothly across all device sizes.
- Refactored EJS templates to avoid repetitive code and make use of reusable components like the navbar and footer.

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in full-stack web development:

- **CRUD structure**: I solidified my understanding of how to implement the basic create, read, update, and delete operations, with seamless communication between frontend forms and backend server logic.
- **Reusable components**: Building with EJS taught me the importance of reusable components for scalable and maintainable UI design.
- **JavaScript DOM manipulation**: Adding the image preview functionality required deeper insight into event listeners, file handling, and DOM updates with JavaScript.
- **Styling and UX improvements**: Enhancing the styling with custom Bootstrap and ensuring a user-friendly experience gave me insight into balancing design with functionality.
